### üëãüèΩ Hello I'm Jayant Uppal

Currently diving deep into the tech world as a Software Development Engineer - 2 at PeopleStrong. I've led the transition of HRM application modules from monolithic architecture to microservices, optimized high-cost queries, and managed ad-hoc teams to ensure timely deliveries.

üöÄ‚ú® With a strong foundation in Computer Science from the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies and specialized training in Data Science & Machine Learning from Scaler‚Äôs DSML Program, I've found my sweet spot in software development and machine learning engineering. 

üåá My technical expertise spans across Java, Python, SQL, and various frameworks like Spring MVC, Springboot, and Hibernate. I've also delved into machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, and I'm proficient in data analysis and visualization using tools like Excel, Tableau, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

üõ†Ô∏èüí° As a key contributor to multiple projects, I've developed and optimized RESTful APIs, created SQL procedures, and streamlined build and deployment processes with Python and batch scripts. My leadership qualities and technical skills have earned me two promotions in two years, reaching the position of Software Development Engineer 2.

üìö When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to the tech community through publications and hackathons. I co-authored papers on machine learning approaches for skin disease classification and sign language recognition, and I mentored a finalist team at the Smart India Hackathon 2023.

üèî Outside of work, I'm always eager to discuss the latest in tech, share insights on best practices, or brainstorm over new projects. Let's connect and add a spark to the tech world together üî•‚ú®
