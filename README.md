### üëãüèΩ Hello, I'm Jayant Uppal

I‚Äôm currently making strides as a **Software Development Engineer - 2**, where I‚Äôve led key initiatives, including transforming monolithic architectures into microservices, optimizing high-cost queries, and orchestrating team efforts to deliver robust solutions.

üöÄ‚ú® With a foundation in **Computer Science** from UPES and specialized training in **Data Science & Machine Learning** through Scaler‚Äôs DSML Program, my passion for building intelligent systems drives my work in **software development and machine learning**. I thrive at the intersection of engineering and machine learning, where code meets data-driven insights.

### üß† Technical Expertise:
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Java, Python, SQL, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Hibernate
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Proficient with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and deep learning architectures (NN, CNN, RNN)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Excel, Tableau, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

üõ†Ô∏èüí° I have developed scalable REST APIs, crafted complex SQL procedures, and implemented data pipelines using batch scripting and Python. My work emphasizes building resilient systems, and I have mentored junior developers and led multiple releases from start to finish.

üìö I‚Äôm also a contributor to the tech community through **publications and hackathons**. I co-authored research on **machine learning for skin disease classification** and **sign language recognition** and mentored a finalist team at **Smart India Hackathon 2023**.
